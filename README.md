# Welcome at coding for everyone!

Everybody can code! Coding for everyone (CFE) was made to make that true.

## How does it work?
Every CFE version has 3 lines these lines act as the main command lines.
After there has been a main command entered there will be asked for a subcommand this subcommand can also have more subcommands.
### How do I use it?
CFC is coded in JS (Javascript). You can use it with these programs:
1. With a web browser
    * Only when the web browser supports JS 
2. With a program that supports HTML
    * Has to support JS
3. With a program that supports JS

When you're not able to find one of these programs try to use:
* Safari
* Google Chrome
